    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model.

      "**Health:**\n",
      "*   **mRNA Vaccine Technology Expansion:** Building on COVID-19 success, mRNA technology is now being explored for a wider range of diseases, including cancer and autoimmune disorders. Practical applications are imminent, with timelines for new vaccines potentially within 3-5 years.\n",
      "*   **AI in Diagnostics:** Artificial intelligence is significantly improving the speed and accuracy of medical image analysis and disease diagnosis. Widespread integration into clinical practice is expected within 2-4 years.\n",
      "*   **Long-Acting Injectables:** Treatments like Lenacapavir for HIV offer long-acting prevention and treatment, reducing the need for daily adherence. Further advancements for other conditions are anticipated within 5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Technology:**\n",
      "*   **Generative AI Advancements:** Generative AI is rapidly evolving, moving beyond chatbots to deeper applications in education, healthcare, and office environments, with AI smartphones and glasses emerging. Widespread adoption is ongoing, with significant impact expected within 1-3 years.\n",
      "*   **Quantum Computing Maturation:** While full-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing is still some way off, practical applications in areas like drug discovery, materials science, and finance are being developed. Initial industry impacts are projected within 5-10 years.\n",
      "*   **Autonomous Systems:** Robots and digital agents are moving from pilot projects to practical applications in logistics, dynamic environments, and as virtual coworkers. Broader deployment is expected within 3-5 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Finance:**\n",
      "*   **AI-Driven Financial Services:** AI is personalizing financial planning, wealth management, and risk assessment, with generative AI enhancing customer interactions and product development. These applications are largely current and rapidly expanding.\n",
      "*   **Blockchain Beyond Crypto:** Blockchain is finding new use cases in supply chain management, digital identity, and voting systems, promising increased transparency and security. Practical implementation is expected within 2-5 years.\n",
      "*   **Quantum-Resistant Encryption:** As quantum computing advances, the development of quantum-resistant encryption is crucial for financial security. This is an emerging area with practical applications anticipated within 5-10 years.\n",

      "CriticAgent > The story presents a compelling hook with Elias, the weathered lighthouse keeper, and the discovery of the mysterious map. However, there are a few areas that could be strengthened to make the narrative more impactful:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deepen Elias's character and motivation:** While Elias is established as weathered and solitary, we don't know *why* he's in this life or what his internal desires or fears are. Giving him a brief internal thought about his past, a longing, or even a current worry would make his discovery more significant. For example, does he yearn for adventure, or is he content with his routine? Understanding this would amplify the impact of the map’s revelation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Enhance the mystery of the map's origin and purpose:** The map is intriguing, but its immediate appearance and Elias's sudden realization of its significance could be further developed. Was there any context to the lighthouse before Elias? Perhaps a legend or a rumor associated with it? Hinting at the map's origin or a specific purpose beyond just \"far from ordinary\" would build more suspense and intrigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Introduce a sense of urgency or immediate consequence:** The discovery is exciting, but there's no immediate pressure or next step presented. The story ends with Elias's realization, but what does he do with this information? Introducing a subtle external element, like a change in the sea's behavior or an unusual signal from the map, could create an immediate need for Elias to act, propelling the story forward.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias, a man weathered by salt spray and solitude, polished the Fresnel lens, its beam slicing through the inky blackness. He’d sought this isolation after the sea had claimed his family, a penance of sorts, yet tonight, the restless beast mirrored a growing unease within him. He yearned for a life beyond the rhythmic hiss of waves and the lonely cry of gulls. As he tidied the small, stone room, his hand brushed against a loose brick, a detail he’d never noticed in his decade of service. Curiosity, a long-dormant ember, flickered to life. He pried it open.\n",

Whispers of old mariners’ tales, of a hidden kingdom and its guardian lighthouse, brushed against his memory. One mark, a shimmering star, was directly beneath his lighthouse. The lonely beacon’s purpose, he suddenly felt, was far from ordinary—it was a key. As if in response, the sea outside surged, a colossal wave crashing against the tower, a powerful tremor running through the stone. The map in his hands flared, the star symbol burning brighter.
