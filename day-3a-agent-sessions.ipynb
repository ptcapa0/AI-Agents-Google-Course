    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **AI for Target Identification and Validation.**\n",
      "\n",
      "This area is fundamentally about **finding the right molecular locks (targets) that drugs can bind to, to fix a disease.** Traditionally, this has been a slow, laborious, and often serendipitous process. AI is changing that by enabling researchers to:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Analyze Unprecedented Amounts of Biological Data:**\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** The sheer volume of biological data generated from sources like genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA expression), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), and electronic health records (EHRs) is too vast for humans to fully comprehend and connect.\n",
      "*   **AI's Solution:** AI algorithms, particularly machine learning and deep learning, can sift through these massive datasets, identify patterns, and uncover subtle relationships that might indicate a protein or gene's involvement in a disease.\n",
      "\n",

      "*   **The Problem:** Many diseases are complex, with multiple contributing factors and intricate biological pathways. It's hard to pinpoint the single most critical element to target.\n",
      "*   **AI's Solution:** AI can build sophisticated models of biological systems and disease progression. By analyzing how different biological components interact, AI can help researchers understand the underlying mechanisms of a disease and identify key nodes (targets) within these pathways that, if modulated, could have a therapeutic effect.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Identify \"Druggable\" Targets:**\n",
      "*   **The Challenge:** Not all biological targets are easy to create drugs for. Some proteins have structures that are difficult for small molecules to bind to effectively.\n",
      "*   **AI's Role:** AI can help predict the \"druggability\" of a target. By analyzing the characteristics of known successful drug targets and their interactions with drugs, AI models can assess the likelihood that a newly identified target can be effectively modulated by a therapeutic agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Prioritize Promising Targets:**\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** A single disease might have hundreds of potential targets. Researchers need to focus their limited resources on the most promising ones.\n",
      "*   **AI's Solution:** AI can rank potential targets based on various criteria, such as their predicted role in disease, their druggability, the availability of existing research, and even the potential for commercial development. This helps prioritize experimental validation efforts.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Accelerate Target Validation:**\n",
      "*   **The Problem:** Once a target is identified, it needs to be validated through experiments to confirm its role in the disease and its potential as a therapeutic target.\n",
      "*   **AI's Contribution:** While AI doesn't replace experimental validation, it can guide it. AI can help design more efficient experiments, predict the outcomes of certain genetic manipulations, and interpret experimental results more quickly.\n",

This allows them to map complex biological relationships and infer potential drug targets.\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** They utilize AI for both target identification and novel molecule generation, often focusing on aging-related diseases and fibrosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this development so significant?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Addresses a bottleneck:** Target identification has historically been a major bottleneck in drug discovery. AI's ability to accelerate and improve this process can have a ripple effect across the entire drug development pipeline.\n",
      "*   **Unlocks new therapeutic possibilities:** By identifying novel targets, AI opens up entirely new avenues for treating diseases that were previously considered intractable.\n",
      "*   **Reduces R&D costs and timelines:** Finding the right target is crucial for the success of a drug. AI's efficiency in this stage can save significant time and resources, making drug development more cost-effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "This development is crucial because it tackles the very first, foundational step of creating a new medicine. If you aim to hit a target, you first need to know what that target is, and AI is proving to be an incredibly powerful tool for discovering and validating those targets.\n",
